# RetroRaycaster

A small Doom-style 2.5D raycasting game written in C++.

## Goals

- Implement a simple raycasting renderer from scratch.
- Build a basic game loop with movement, collision, and shooting.
- Practice C++ design, debugging, and project structure.

## Build

> TODO: fill this in once the first version builds.

## Features (planned)

- Grid-based map with walls.
- First-person 2.5D view using raycasting.
- Player movement and collision.
- At least one enemy type with simple AI and shooting.
